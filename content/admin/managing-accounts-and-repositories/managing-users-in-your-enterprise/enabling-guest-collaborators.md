## About guest collaborators

{% data reusables.emus.guest-collaborators-note %}

If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, you can use the role of guest collaborator to grant limited access to vendors and contractors. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-accounts-and-repositories/managing-users-in-your-enterprise/roles-in-an-enterprise#guest-collaborators)."

All repository access for organization members, including guest collaborators, is governed by the base permission policy for the organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/setting-base-permissions-for-an-organization)."

If you use Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) or Okta for SAML authentication, or if you use Entra ID for OIDC authentication, you may need to update your IdP application to use guest collaborators.

## Enabling guest collaborators with Entra ID

1. Sign into the Microsoft Azure portal.
1. Click **Identity**.
1. Click **Applications**.
1. Click **Enterprise applications**.
1. Click **All applications**.
1. View the details for your {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} application
1. In the left sidebar, click **Users and Groups**.
1. View the application registration.

   - If the application registration displays the "Restricted User" or "Guest Collaborator" roles, you're ready to invite guest collaborators to your enterprise.
   - If the application registration does not display the roles, proceed to the next step.
1. In the Azure portal, click **App registrations**.
1. Click **All applications**, then use the search bar to find your application for {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}.
1. Click your SAML application.
1. In the left sidebar, click **Manifest**.
1. Under "appRoles", add the following:

   ```json
   {
     "allowedMemberTypes": [
       "User"
     ],
     "description": "Guest Collaborator",
     "displayName": "Guest Collaborator",
     "id": "1ebc4a02-e56c-43a6-92a5-02ee09b90824",
     "isEnabled": true,
     "lang": null,
     "origin": "Application",
     "value": "null"
   },
   ```

   {% note %}

   **Note:** The `id` value is critical. If another `id` value is present, the update will fail.

   {% endnote %}
1. Click **Save**.

## Enabling guest collaborators with Okta

To add the guest collaborator role to your Okta application:

1. Navigate to your application for {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %} on Okta.
1. Click **Provisioning**.
1. Click **Go to Profile Editor**.
1. Find "Roles" at the bottom of the profile editor and click the edit icon.
1. Add a new role.

   - For "Display name", type `Guest Collaborator`.
   - For "Value", type `guest_collaborator`.
1. Click **Save**.

## Adding guest collaborators to your enterprise

After you enable guest collaborators, you can add guest collaborators to your enterprise as you would any other user.
