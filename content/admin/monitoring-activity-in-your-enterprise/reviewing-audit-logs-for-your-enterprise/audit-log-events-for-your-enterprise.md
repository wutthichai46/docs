## About audit log events for your enterprise

{% ifversion ghec %}

The scope of the events that appear in your enterprise's audit log depend on whether your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}. For more information about {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/using-enterprise-managed-users-for-iam/about-enterprise-managed-users)."

- If your enterprise does not use {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, the audit log only includes events related to the enterprise account and the organizations within the enterprise account, which are listed in this article.
- If your enterprise uses {% data variables.product.prodname_emus %}, the audit log also includes user events for {% data variables.enterprise.prodname_managed_users %}, such as each time the user logs in to {% data variables.product.product_name %} and actions they take within their user account. For a list of these user account events, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/security-log-events)."
