## About sponsorships

{% data reusables.sponsors.sponsorship-details %}

You can sponsor an account on behalf of your personal account to invest in projects that you personally benefit from. You can sponsor an account on behalf of your organization for many reasons.
- Sustaining specific libraries that your organization's work depends on
- Investing in the ecosystem you rely on as an organization (such as blockchain)
- Developing brand awareness as an organization that values open source
- Thanking open source developers for building libraries that complement the product your organization offers

We may share certain limited tax information with sponsored accounts. For more information, see "[Tax information](#tax-information)."

You can choose whether to display your sponsorship publicly. One-time sponsorships remain visible for one month.

If the sponsored account retires your tier, the tier will remain in place for you until you choose a different tier or cancel your subscription. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-sponsors/upgrading-a-sponsorship)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/billing/managing-billing-for-github-sponsors/downgrading-a-sponsorship)."

If the account you want to sponsor does not have a profile on {% data variables.product.prodname_sponsors %}, you can encourage the account to join. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-personal-account)" and "[AUTOTITLE](/sponsors/receiving-sponsorships-through-github-sponsors/setting-up-github-sponsors-for-your-organization)."
