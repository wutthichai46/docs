**Note:** Unlinking your Patreon account from your {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %} account **will not** cancel any existing sponsorships you have created through Patreon. To stop sponsoring maintainers through Patreon, see [How do I cancel?](https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005502572-How-do-I-cancel-) in the Patreon documentation.
