If you or your organization employs security measures like a firewall or proxy server, it may be beneficial to include certain domain URLs in an "allowlist" and open specific ports and protocols. Doing so will enhance your installation and usage of {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} for an optimal experience.

## URLs to add to an allowlist

Due to {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %}'s interaction with a remote machine learning model and its update checking functionality, it is recommended to include the following domain URLs in the allowlist, marking them as trusted either in the user interface or within your deployment scripts.

| Domain and/or URL                      | Purpose |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `https://github.com/login/*`             | Authentication |
| `https://api.github.com/user`             | User Management |
| `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/*` | User Management |
| `https://copilot-telemetry.githubusercontent.com/telemetry` | Telemetry |
| `https://default.exp-tas.com/` | Telemetry |
| `https://copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com/` | API service for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggestions |
| `https://origin-tracker.githubusercontent.com` | API service for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggestions |
| `https://*.githubcopilot.com` | API service for {% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} suggestions |

Additional domains and URLs may require allowlisting, depending on your organization's security policies and the editors in use. For more information about specific editors, see "[Further reading](#further-reading)."
