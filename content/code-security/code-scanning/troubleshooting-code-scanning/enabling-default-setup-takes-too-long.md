If enabling your default setup is taking too long, try canceling the workflow run and restarting the setup.

To restart your setup, navigate to the main page of your repository, then click {% octicon "play" aria-hidden="true" %} **Actions**. Click the **{% data variables.product.prodname_codeql %}** workflow run that's in progress, then click **Cancel workflow**. Once {% octicon "stop" aria-label="cancelled" %} appears beside the workflow run name, navigate back to the **Code security and analysis** settings and re-enable the default setup. If the default setup continues to stall, please contact {% data variables.contact.contact_support %} or try enabling the advanced setup.
