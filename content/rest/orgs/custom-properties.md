## About custom properties

You can use the REST API to create and manage custom properties for an organization. You can use custom properties to add metadata to repositories in your organization. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-organization-settings/managing-custom-properties-for-repositories-in-your-organization)."

{% note %}

**Note:** The API endpoints for custom properties are in public beta and subject to change.
