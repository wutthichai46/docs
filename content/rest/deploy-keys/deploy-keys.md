## About deploy keys

{% data reusables.repositories.deploy-keys %}

Deploy keys can either be set up using the following API endpoints, or by using the {% data variables.product.company_short %} web interface. To learn how to set deploy keys up in the web interface, see "[AUTOTITLE](/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys)."

There are a few cases when a deploy key will be deleted by other activity:

- If the deploy key is created with a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}, deleting the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} will also delete the deploy key. Regenerating the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} will not delete the deploy key.
- If the deploy key is created with an {% data variables.product.prodname_oauth_app %} token, revoking the token will also delete the deploy key.

Conversely, these activities will not delete a deploy key:

- If the deploy key is created with a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} user access token, revoking the token will not delete the deploy key.
- If the deploy key is created with a {% data variables.product.prodname_github_app %} installation access token, uninstalling or deleting the app will not delete the deploy key.
- If the deploy key is created with a {% data variables.product.pat_generic %}, regenerating the {% data variables.product.pat_generic %} will not delete the deploy key.
