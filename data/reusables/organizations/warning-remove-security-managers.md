**Warning:** Removing the security manager role from a team will remove the team's ability to manage security alerts and settings across the organization, but the team will retain read access to repositories that was granted when the role was assigned. You must remove any unwanted read access manually. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-user-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/managing-repository-roles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository#removing-a-teams-access-to-a-repository)."
