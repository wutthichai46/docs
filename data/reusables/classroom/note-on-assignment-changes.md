{% note %}

**Note:** In January 2024, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} will change the way student repositories are created from starter code repositories. Currently, the process requires starter code repositories to be templates, and {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} creates a new repository for each student based on that template. With the upcoming change, student repositories will be created by forking the starter code repository.

This change addresses a frequently requested feature from teachers: the ability to change starter code after an assignment has been accepted by students.

You can read more about this change on the [{% data variables.product.company_short %} blog](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-12-08-upcoming-changes-to-assignment-repositories-and-starter-code-in-github-classroom/).

This feature is in public beta and subject to change.
