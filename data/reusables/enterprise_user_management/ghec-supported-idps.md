{% data reusables.enterprise_user_management.emu-paved-path-iam-integrations %} If you use a partner IdP, you can configure one application on your IdP to provide authentication and provisioning. If you don't use a partner IdP, or if you only use a partner IdP for authentication, you can integrate IdPs that implement the SAML 2.0 and System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) 2.0 standards. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/admin/identity-and-access-management/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users#about-authentication-and-user-provisioning)."
