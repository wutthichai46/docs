  security_fixes:
    - HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is enabled within the Management Console.
    - To prevent commits from a detached repository from syncing to prior forks that are now in a separate repository network, GitHub Enterprise Server closes pull requests between repositories during detachment.
    - Packages have been updated to the latest security versions.
  bugs:
    - When displaying a list of subdomains in the Management Console, the list included the outdated `render` subdomain, and excluded the newer `containers`, `docker`, `notebook`, and `viewscreen` subdomains.
    - On an instance in a cluster configuration, the Cluster-Balance daemon would run against jobs not specified in the configuration.
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, and when using Safari, changing additional match requirements for a custom pattern did not retrigger custom pattern evaluation against a user submitted test string.
    - When viewing git blame data, the reviewer menu was loaded even when the suggested reviewer calculation timed out.
    - When uploading migration archives to blob storage, the GitHub Enterprise Server instance's outbound web proxy server was not used.
    - Duplicated intermediate commit trailers won't appear in pull request squash messages.
    - On an enterprise with the policy setting that disallows repository admins from enabling/disabling secret scanning, transferring a repository to a new organization that automatically enabled secret scanning wouldn't result in the transferred repository being automatically enabled for secret scanning.
    - When migrating a repository from a GitHub Enterprise Server instance to another location, the `ghe-migrator target_url` command allows you to record the repository's new location. The new URL is displayed when you visit the main page of the repository in the web interface.
    - On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to incorrect asset paths.
    - On an instance with subdomain isolation disabled, a notebook could not be loaded due to an extra `/` character in the URL path.
    - On an instance with a GitHub Advanced Security license and secret scanning enabled, in some cases, custom patterns would erroneously show no results for a dry run.

  changes:
    - Site administrators can see improved diagnostic information about repositories that have been deleted.
    - When providing data to GitHub Support, GitHub Enterprise Server displays a notice describing how support data is used before uploading the support files.
    - On an instance with multiple nodes, internal tooling to repair repositories now attempts to resolve problems within the entire repository network.

      Custom firewall rules are removed during the upgrade process.

      During the validation phase of a configuration run, a `No such object` error may occur for the Notebook and Viewscreen services. This error can be ignored as the services should still correctly start.

      If the root site administrator is locked out of the Management Console after failed login attempts, the account does not unlock automatically after the defined lockout time. Someone with administrative SSH access to the instance must unlock the account using the administrative shell. For more information, see "[Troubleshooting access to the Management Console](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.8/admin/configuration/administering-your-instance-from-the-management-console/troubleshooting-access-to-the-management-console#unlocking-the-root-site-administrator-account)."

      On an instance in a high-availability configuration, passive replica nodes accept Git client requests and forward the requests to the primary node.
    - |
      If an instance is configured to forward logs to a target server with TLS enabled, certificate authority (CA) bundles that a site administrator uploads using `ghe-ssl-ca-certificate-install` are not respected, and connections to the server fail.
    - |
      When running `ghe-config-apply`, the process may stall with the message `Deployment is running pending automatic promotion`.
